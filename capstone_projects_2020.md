## BRAVO 2020

[Community Kitchen](https://floating-reaches-65868.herokuapp.com/) - Ruben, Ara, Jazmyn, April
<br />
During these hard times we’re living in, the need for community is stronger than ever.
And not just a community for specific people or classes, but a community that would benefit everyone. Thus Community Kitchen was born.
The way it works is If you have food that you can donate you can list your items on Community Kitchen for anyone that may need a meal. So many of our neighborhoods are experiencing a need for food due to illness and/or lack of money to purchase food.
Thus a hopeful solution to a problem we are experiencing in our world today.
