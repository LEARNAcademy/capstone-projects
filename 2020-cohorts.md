## DELTA 2020

[LifeBand](https://fathomless-woodland-26064.herokuapp.com/) - Bach, Diem, Nate  
Oftentimes, when a person is brought incapacitated or nonverbal to the ER, their loved ones are not able to provide medical professionals the vital information necessary to give the individual the best possible care. Because of this, many people live in fear, choosing to not pursue risky activities or even eat at new restaurants in case the need for medical attention arises with professionals who do not know them or their needs. LifeBand is a simple but life changing tool that we have developed to help give each individual the opportunity to take their life back from their ailments. We here at Life Science Rejects understand that every person is unique in their medical needs and that they must be communicated, no matter what! When you create an account with LifeBand, you are simply filling out a form giving all important information that YOU as the patient would like to be known. A QR code is then generated for you to share with your loved ones that redirects to your profile. We urge you to take care of yourself and be an advocate for your health, so let's band up on LifeBand!
