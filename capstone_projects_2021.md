[ Fate ](https://glacial-tundra-45968.herokuapp.com/) - Brian, Chris, Galadoe, Trey 
Fate is an app that holds the promise of a community.
Fate is a simple, elegant community. A place where you can anonymously share each other through the interests you have. As an app, Fate allows users to view collections of photos that they share interests in categories. The app will then allow the user, when logged in, to share with other users. This will allow users to share content with each other and foster a better future within our community.

[ PepWalk ](https://quiet-beyond-69564.herokuapp.com/) - Andy, Heather, Jared, Lauralyn
Exercising has been proven to have many health benefits but it can be very hard to start building new fitness habits especially when most people's motivations come from a change in their physique which let’s face it doesn’t happen overnight.. So it can be very easy to lose interest and motivation, but did you know one of the biggest health benefits from regular exercise is a major improvement in your mental health? Exercising provides an outlet for your stress, anxiety  and depression. It also helps improve your memory, thought process and it even makes you sleep better! So we at PepWalk came up with a solution to fill those gaps in motivation by providing you with an app that keeps track of what exercise you did for the day and more importantly how you’re feeling throughout your day! Logging your mood and seeing the internal benefits that you’re reaping from your fitness journey or lack thereof has so much more value to it than stepping on a scale or looking in the mirror.  Looking back at your entries will help you get a clearer understanding that what you’re doing is actually working, not just on the outside but on the inside as well!
