## Charlie 2022

<!-- [Learnify](https://learnify-capstone.herokuapp.com/) -->

<!-- [Judoten](http://judoten.com/)  -->
**Judoten** - Damien, Denise, Lance  
Our App is called JudoTen.
The word "ten" in Japanese means "spot or mark". Which is fitting because our app helps users find spots where Judo is taught. As a Judo coach, people (including the rest of the Ninjaneers) tell me how difficult it is to find a dojo that teaches judo. This problem was made worse during the pandemic when many Judo dojos had to close down, including the one I started at. And a lot of Judo is taught as a mere accessory at Dojos that specialize in other martial arts. As a Judo coach, I am trying to keep Judo alive and that starts with people being able to find it.
